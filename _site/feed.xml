        <title>The Best Halloween Events in the Bay This Year</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hx6uV17z-Dg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you ready for some fun in the Bay Area this Halloween? Here are the events that you need to attend this month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Fun in the Bay: Halloween Edition. We have some really fun events coming up in the area that we want to give you the lowdown on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, we have the Speakeasy SF Halloween Party Cruise&lt;/strong&gt;. On October 27 from 8:00 PM until 1:00 AM and it will be taking place on a 3-story, 30,000-square-foot yacht—the largest such boat on the West Coast. It’s a flapper-themed party that you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/speakeasy-sf-halloween-party-cruise-tickets-49208382597?aff=ebdssbdestsearch&quot;&gt;get tickets for and learn much more about here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next, we have the Oakland Zoo’s Boo at the Zoo, which is going to be a great event for the whole family&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s taking place on October 27 and 28 from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Once you pay for admission into the zoo, you’ll be able to stroll the zoo in costume while collecting yummy treats. You’ll also be able to go for a ride on the spooky boo train, join in on a cool dance party, get your face painted, and make some treats for the animals. All kids who show up in costume will receive a free ride ticket. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oaklandzoo.org/programs-and-events/boo-at-the-zoo&quot;&gt;Learn more about this fun event here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There’s plenty of Halloween events for you to enjoy this month.%20http://localhost:4000/the-best-halloween-events-in-the-bay-this-year.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There’s plenty of Halloween events for you to enjoy this month.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you really want to get your party on, I have the event for you&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s the Vices SF Nightlife’s Halloween Thriller at The Recovery Room (4528 Mission St.) on Halloween night, October 31, from 9:00 PM until 2:00 AM. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-thriller-tickets-50682360304?aff=ebdssbdestsearch&quot;&gt;Here’s a link to grab tickets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s not your scene, &lt;strong&gt;consider attending the Halloween Dance Party at Eve’s Waterfront&lt;/strong&gt;, a great restaurant in the Bay Area. It’s located on the water in Oakland and taking place from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM. There will be multiple DJs spinning records, a fun dance party, ghostly eats, and a welcome cocktail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-party-eves-waterfront-tickets-50499827343?aff=ebdssbdestsearch&quot;&gt;You can get tickets to the event here&lt;/a&gt; (early-bird tickets are only $20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it—&lt;strong&gt;some of the best events taking place this month in the Bay Area&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have any questions about any of the events above or about anything related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email any time. I look forward to hearing from you soon, and I hope you have a safe and happy Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sellers, Beware These 9 Homebuyer Turn-Offs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_G08RKNdEg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might not realize it, but you could be sabotaging your own home sale. Here are nine things that can turn buyers off your listing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nine silly little things you could be unknowingly doing that will sabotage the sale of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Pesky hanging cords&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it seems small and insignificant, but the cords that hang down behind a mounted TV might put buyers on watch for other issues in the home that make it look messy. Just tuck those cords up and away before giving people a tour of the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. An unkept yard&lt;/strong&gt;. No one likes a mess, especially when they’re planning to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on it. Buyers want to see a clean, crisp yard with nice ground cover and well-cut grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A dingy front door&lt;/strong&gt;. Replacing your front door and/or garage door can bring you up to a 100% ROI, so if your door is dinged up or sun-faded, do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and replace or repair it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Obvious signs of pets&lt;/strong&gt;. Though you may love your furry friends, it’s a gamble to assume that buyers will also love them. Some people are allergic to pet dander, are highly sensitive to smells, or simply don’t like the messes animals tend to leave. Clean up after your pets before inviting buyers in, and certainly get rid of any odors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Cobwebs&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though I bought my own condo in spite of the fact it was covered in cobwebs, you can’t expect that from most people. The sight of cobwebs is an instant turn-off for a lot of people. Dust those webs away to show buyers how clean your home is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Though you may love your furry friends, it’s a gamble to assume that buyers will also love them.%20http://localhost:4000/sellers-beware-these-9-homebuyer-turn-offs.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Though you may love your furry friends, it’s a gamble to assume that buyers will also love them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Poor furniture arrangement&lt;/strong&gt;. This is why it’s critical to consult a stager—we can’t sell houses the same way we live in them. When you work with us, we pay for a stager to come in to arrange everything to look nice and inviting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Junk drawers and crammed cabinets&lt;/strong&gt;. Buyers are naturally going to look inside cabinets and drawers, so if yours are jam-packed full of odds and ends, it’ll turn them off. Thin out some of your possessions to make your home showable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Messy closets&lt;/strong&gt;. People look in closets to try to imagine what it would look like if it held their own possessions, but imagining that is hard to do if your closet is crammed full. Take a weekend to declutter your closet space and your buyers will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Cluttered countertops&lt;/strong&gt;. Move the sundry items you keep on your counters to a storage space. People want to be able to picture themselves living in your home, but they won’t be able to if it’s not clean and crisp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me, please feel free to reach out. See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Shift Is Underway in Our Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfJQq1s6Aac?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our market is going through a slowdown, so if you&amp;rsquo;re a seller, you need to put your home on the market now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the latest statistics from our market and what they mean for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average days on market is 45 days, while the median is 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average list price is $1.63 million.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The median sale price is $1.3 million.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lowest listing is $298,000, while the highest is $39 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, the average days on market was 17 days, so we’ve seen a significant uptick since then. &lt;strong&gt;We’re also seeing a significant shift in terms of pricing&lt;/strong&gt;. The average list price in the 68 Corridor is $1,142,524, while the average sale price is $1,160,757. Although that’s a good-looking list-to-sale price difference, we’re still experiencing a slowdown, and I’m really kind of terrified to see where that’s going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’re still experiencing a slowdown, and I’m really kind of terrified to see where that’s going.%20http://localhost:4000/a-shift-is-underway-in-our-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’re still experiencing a slowdown, and I’m really kind of terrified to see where that’s going.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re thinking about listing your home, get into the market and list your property now&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re seeing either complete stagnation or price reductions from other listings across the board. Even in the more affordable price ranges, we’re seeing price reductions of as much as $50,000, which can really hurt you in terms of the equity you were planning on getting from your home sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re thinking of selling or buying a property soon in our market, I’d love to help you, so don’t hesitate to give me a call so we can get started. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We’re Giving You and Your Family the Gift of Vacation</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-X7AbBc-Hc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;To thank you for supporting our content, my team and I would like to extend a special offer to you and your family.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this August, I have been bringing you informative videos about our market for four full years. With that in mind, I want to ask you a simple question: Do you hate me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I’m joking, but the reason I ask is, even after all of this time, some of you have still never reached out. Don’t get me wrong—I understand how busy things can get. In fact, that’s one of the major reasons I do what I do. I want to serve as a convenient resource for all your real estate needs, and today I’d like to offer you something else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you like to go on vacation?  Well, now is your chance. All you need to do is visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcdanielcallahanvacation.com/go22460135&quot;&gt;McDanielCallahanVacation.com&lt;/a&gt; to book your stay. Up to two adults and two children can register, so I encourage you and your family to take advantage of this great opportunity. If you cover airfare and the tax for your hotel rooms, I’ll pay for the rest of any resort package you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you cover airfare and the tax for your hotel rooms, I’ll pay for the rest of any resort package you choose.%20http://localhost:4000/were-giving-you-and-your-family-the-gift-of-vacation.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you cover airfare and the tax for your hotel rooms, I’ll pay for the rest of any resort package you choose.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After following the instructions on our website and reading the terms and conditions, you and your family will be all set to let the worries of the world wash away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do take advantage of this opportunity, be sure to tag our team in any photos you post. We would love to see how you and your loved ones spent your vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Ways Buyers Can Prepare for Closing</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rdz_pb8r84E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have had your offer accepted and are on your way to the closing table, there are still a few things you need to take care of. Today I will highlight four ways to prepare for closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Looking to buy a Bay Area Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buyandsellalamodanvillehomes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all Bay Area homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Selling Your Bay Area Home? &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudcma.com/api_widget/6757802779fbc05a66bfd8f78d617a92/show?post_url=cloudcma.com&amp;amp;source_url=ua&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Use our home evaluation tool.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens at the closing table when you’re buying a house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I will go over what to expect, as well as a few crucial do’s and don’ts to follow as you move through the process. Keeping all of this information in mind will be very important in making sure you get the keys to your new home with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Schedule the closing.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the time, your agent will coordinate with all parties involved to schedule the closing for you. That said, it is still important to make sure this gets done. Also, make sure you take your time at the closing table. Don’t try to squeeze in the meeting over your lunch hour, because there will be a lot of critical documents to look over. I recommend taking a half-day to make sure you’ve got adequate time to review all papers carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Do a final walk-through.&lt;/strong&gt; As a buyer, you have the right to go through the home within five days of closing and make sure that it’s still in an acceptable condition. You are entitled to take possession of the home in the exact state it was in when your offer on the property was accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ANY CHANGES TO YOUR DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO WILL POSE A HUGE THREAT TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR HOME PURCHASE.%20http://localhost:4000/4-ways-buyers-can-prepare-for-closing.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ANY CHANGES TO YOUR DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO WILL POSE A HUGE THREAT TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR HOME PURCHASE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take all the documents with you to closing.&lt;/strong&gt; If any issues arise, you will be able to provide any and all necessary paperwork needed to resolve those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Keep in mind the things that could go wrong with your deal.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a few pitfalls you may encounter. This includes things like the bank pulling out at the last minute or an unexpected lien showing up, but the greatest problem that could occur is actually within the buyer’s control. Any changes to your debt-to-income ratio will pose a huge threat to the success of your home purchase. This means that you need to make sure you put off any major purchases, especially those made on credit, until after closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more things to keep in mind before proceeding to closing when buying or selling a home. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Ways to Back out of a Home Purchase Without Being a Jerk</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ni7JxqsEI9s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it ever okay to back out of a deal? Yes. Today, I’ll highlight three examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Looking to buy a Bay Area Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buyandsellalamodanvillehomes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all Bay Area homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Selling Your Bay Area Home? &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudcma.com/api_widget/6757802779fbc05a66bfd8f78d617a92/show?post_url=cloudcma.com&amp;amp;source_url=ua&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Use our home evaluation tool.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backing out of a home purchase can make you seem like a big jerk, but it doesn’t have to. There are three ways you can get out of a deal without coming off as rude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. If you’re unhappy with the physical inspection.&lt;/strong&gt; No matter how excited you were to purchase a home in the beginning, an unsavory inspection report can be a sure way to burst that bubble. If a home just isn’t right for you, or has problems you just can’t look past, it’s often best to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. If your purchase is contingent upon the sale of your current home.&lt;/strong&gt; If your current home doesn’t go under contract within the designated time frame, you have no obligation to go through with the purchase. This contingency can act as your “Get Out of Jail Free” card, and save you from juggling two mortgages at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=IF A HOME JUST ISN’T RIGHT FOR YOU, OR HAS PROBLEMS YOU JUST CAN’T LOOK PAST, IT’S OFTEN BEST TO WALK AWAY.%20http://localhost:4000/3-ways-to-back-out-of-home-purchase.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“IF A HOME JUST ISN’T RIGHT FOR YOU, OR HAS PROBLEMS YOU JUST CAN’T LOOK PAST, IT’S OFTEN BEST TO WALK AWAY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. If the homeowners association documents raise a red flag.&lt;/strong&gt; When you purchase a home in a homeowners association (or HOA), you’ll receive a huge stack of documents outlining the rules, regulations, and fees that will apply to you if you choose to go through with the purchase. We want to see what kind of finances the HOA has, how the board is, what the facility is like and if it will need any maintenance down the road, and also if you as a homeowner will have to put up a large chunk of money to add to reserves if there is a special assessment that is called. I highly recommend that you review these documents carefully before committing yourself to living in an HOA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a buyer’s market in the Alamo/Danville area, but as a buyer, you still need to be patient and be smart when you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am joined by my father Terry McDaniel to share the latest news from our Alamo/Danville market. &lt;strong&gt;Right now, the numbers tell us it is a great time to buy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Alamo, there are 38 homes available for sale, and the median asking price for these homes is $2.15 million. There are also 27 pending properties, which is almost ideal because you usually want to see a 1:1 ratio between available properties and pending properties. The median price of these pending homes is $1.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stats indicate that the lower part of the market is the most active, while the upper part is starting to see homes with price adjustments of $50,000, $75,000, and even $100,000. This kind of thing is typical when interest rates are rising, so be patient and be smart when you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember — &lt;strong&gt;you only make money when you buy; you don’t make money when you sell.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a number of properties that have not hit the market yet, and prices are not rising at the crazy rate that they previously were. If you are a buyer, these facts should help you during your negotiations with sellers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Alamo, there are about 5,500 homes in total. In Danville, there are about twice as many. To find the home that is right for you, it is very important that you calibrate for each price range and move in $250,000 increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE VERY BEST PROPERTY YOU CAN BUY.%20http://localhost:4000/a-quick-market-update-for-alamodanville.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE VERY BEST PROPERTY YOU CAN BUY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure you plot out the houses. The west side of Alamo, for instance, is going to be more expensive as far as lots go. The lot values in that area are between $1.3 million and $1.5 million, which is an increase compared to when they were worth between $900,000 and $1.2 million four years ago. Can they continue to go up in value? Absolutely. Will they continue to go up in value? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home values can rise and fall, but in 10 to 20 years, you will be glad you bought a property now. A leveraged asset in residential real estate is a great way to accommodate your family’s future. &lt;strong&gt;There are many ways to buy property, so don’t assume you can’t afford it.&lt;/strong&gt; If you talk to us, we can make it happen for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in discussing the market further with my father or you would like to know the value of your home, you can reach him by phone at (925) 838-4300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any other questions for me or you have any real estate needs at all, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Much Do You Pay Uncle Sam in Property Taxes? </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F4NohVJO3f0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ll give you an idea of what you should expect to pay in property taxes and how you’ll pay that amount.&lt;/p&gt;

Selling Your Bay Area Home? &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudcma.com/api_widget/6757802779fbc05a66bfd8f78d617a92/show?post_url=cloudcma.com&amp;amp;source_url=ua&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Use our home evaluation tool.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much money do you need to pay Uncle Sam when it comes to your property taxes? Let’s find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your home is worth $200,000 and your tax rate is 1.5%. This means on an annual basis, you’d pay $3,000 (or $250 per month). There can be additional taxes, fees, and assessments added to this number, so double-check with your tax assessor to make sure you’re paying the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have an idea of what you’ll have to pay, you need to figure out how you’ll pay it. This part is actually pretty simple. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re paying a mortgage, you’ll most likely have an impound account set up with your lender.&lt;/strong&gt; Every single month, your lender (or whoever holds your note) will collect money out of that account for insurance purposes or property tax purposes. They’ll then put that money into an escrow account so it can be paid when it’s due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND YOUR PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT ARE SEPARATE.%20http://localhost:4000/how-much-do-you-pay-uncle-sam-in.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND YOUR PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT ARE SEPARATE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to note because a lot of people think that they pay their property taxes along with their mortgage. In reality, these payments are separate from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t have a mortgage, it’s your responsibility to make your property tax payment to your tax assessor or the tax board.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about property taxes, you have any other real estate questions, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Choose Positivity?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JodG_Xd7M9M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice to be kind is in your hands. It isn’t always easy, but I’d like to challenge you to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all encountered toxic people, but what’s the best way to handle these individuals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start out, let me tell you a story. I was recently making a few follow-up calls when I encountered a gentleman who seemed to be generally angry with life. &lt;strong&gt;A lot of things were said in the conversation that I could have reacted negatively to, but I decided to do something against that impulse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gentleman was upset at me having called his elderly mother, who had expressed interest in selling her home with me. He insinuated I was harassing her, which obviously wasn’t my intention. But instead of reacting with a negative attitude, I defended my position and asked him to help me understand his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I allowed the gentleman to explain his position, then de-escalated the situation by expressing empathy and solidarity.&lt;/strong&gt; I offered to take him out of my database, apologized for the situation at hand, and ended the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO REMAIN POSITIVE.%20http://localhost:4000/why-choose-positivity.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO REMAIN POSITIVE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I still felt slightly shaken up by what had just happened, I was able to step away from the situation knowing I chose not to let it get out of hand. We have this same choice in every interaction we’re a part of. You can and should always choose kindness. People may push our buttons, but you always have the choice to remain positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember that &lt;strong&gt;we have no way of knowing what another person is going through, so try to avoid falling into negative behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn’t related to our usual topics, but I do think it’s important. So, take this message and apply it in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, would like more information, or need help with any of your real estate needs, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
