Today I will highlight four ways to prepare for closing.Looking to buy a Bay Area Home? Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.What happens at the closing table when youâre buying a house?Today I will go over what to expect, as well as a few crucial doâs and donâts to follow as you move through the process. Keeping all of this information in mind will be very important in making sure you get the keys to your new home with no problems.1. Schedule the closing. Most of the time, your agent will coordinate with all parties involved to schedule the closing for you. That said, it is still important to make sure this gets done. Also, make sure you take your time at the closing table. Donât try to squeeze in the meeting over your lunch hour, because there will be a lot of critical documents to look over. I recommend taking a half-day to make sure youâve got adequate time to review all papers carefully.2. Do a final walk-through. As a buyer, you have the right to go through the home within five days of closing and make sure that itâs still in an acceptable condition. You are entitled to take possession of the home in the exact state it was in when your offer on the property was accepted.âANY CHANGES TO YOUR DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO WILL POSE A HUGE THREAT TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR HOME PURCHASE.â3. Take all the documents with you to closing. If any issues arise, you will be able to provide any and all necessary paperwork needed to resolve those problems.4. Keep in mind the things that could go wrong with your deal. There are a few pitfalls you may encounter. This includes things like the bank pulling out at the last minute or an unexpected lien showing up, but the greatest problem that could occur is actually within the buyerâs control. Any changes to your debt-to-income ratio will pose a huge threat to the success of your home purchase. This means that you need to make sure you put off any major purchases, especially those made on credit, until after closing.There are many more things to keep in mind before proceeding to closing when buying or selling a home. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Is it ever okay to back out of a deal? Yes. Today, Iâll highlight three examples.Looking to buy a Bay Area Home? Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.Backing out of a home purchase can make you seem like a big jerk, but it doesnât have to. There are three ways you can get out of a deal without coming off as rude:1. If youâre unhappy with the physical inspection. No matter how excited you were to purchase a home in the beginning, an unsavory inspection report can be a sure way to burst that bubble. If a home just isnât right for you, or has problems you just canât look past, itâs often best to walk away.2. If your purchase is contingent upon the sale of your current home. If your current home doesnât go under contract within the designated time frame, you have no obligation to go through with the purchase. This contingency can act as your âGet Out of Jail Freeâ card, and save you from juggling two mortgages at once.âIF A HOME JUST ISNâT RIGHT FOR YOU, OR HAS PROBLEMS YOU JUST CANâT LOOK PAST, ITâS OFTEN BEST TO WALK AWAY.â3. If the homeowners association documents raise a red flag. When you purchase a home in a homeowners association (or HOA), youâll receive a huge stack of documents outlining the rules, regulations, and fees that will apply to you if you choose to go through with the purchase. We want to see what kind of finances the HOA has, how the board is, what the facility is like and if it will need any maintenance down the road, and also if you as a homeowner will have to put up a large chunk of money to add to reserves if there is a special assessment that is called. I highly recommend that you review these documents carefully before committing yourself to living in an HOA.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.Today I am joined by my father Terry McDaniel to share the latest news from our Alamo/Danville market. Right now, the numbers tell us it is a great time to buy.In Alamo, there are 38 homes available for sale, and the median asking price for these homes is $2.15 million. There are also 27 pending properties, which is almost ideal because you usually want to see a 1:1 ratio between available properties and pending properties. The median price of these pending homes is $1.7 million.These stats indicate that the lower part of the market is the most active, while the upper part is starting to see homes with price adjustments of $50,000, $75,000, and even $100,000. This kind of thing is typical when interest rates are rising, so be patient and be smart when you buy.Remember â you only make money when you buy; you donât make money when you sell. There are a number of properties that have not hit the market yet, and prices are not rising at the crazy rate that they previously were. If you are a buyer, these facts should help you during your negotiations with sellersIn Alamo, there are about 5,500 homes in total. In Danville, there are about twice as many. To find the home that is right for you, it is very important that you calibrate for each price range and move in $250,000 increments.âMAKE SURE YOU PICK THE VERY BEST PROPERTY YOU CAN BUY.âAlso, make sure you plot out the houses. The west side of Alamo, for instance, is going to be more expensive as far as lots go. The lot values in that area are between $1.3 million and $1.5 million, which is an increase compared to when they were worth between $900,000 and $1.2 million four years ago. Can they continue to go up in value? Absolutely. Will they continue to go up in value? Absolutely.Home values can rise and fall, but in 10 to 20 years, you will be glad you bought a property now. A leveraged asset in residential real estate is a great way to accommodate your familyâs future. There are many ways to buy property, so donât assume you canât afford it.

Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.How much money do you need to pay Uncle Sam when it comes to your property taxes? Letâs find out.Letâs say your home is worth $200,000 and your tax rate is 1.5%. This means on an annual basis, youâd pay $3,000 (or $250 per month). There can be additional taxes, fees, and assessments added to this number, so double-check with your tax assessor to make sure youâre paying the right amount.Now that you have an idea of what youâll have to pay, you need to figure out how youâll pay it. This part is actually pretty simple. If youâre paying a mortgage, youâll most likely have an impound account set up with your lender. Every single month, your lender (or whoever holds your note) will collect money out of that account for insurance purposes or property tax purposes. Theyâll then put that money into an escrow account so it can be paid when itâs due.âYOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND YOUR PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT ARE SEPARATE.âThis is important to note because a lot of people think that they pay their property taxes along with their mortgage. In reality, these payments are separate from each other.If you donât have a mortgage, itâs your responsibility to make your property tax payment to your tax assessor or the tax board.If you have any questions about property taxes, you have any other real estate questions, or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, donât hesitate to call or email me anytime.

Use our home evaluation tool.Weâve all encountered toxic people, but whatâs the best way to handle these individuals?To start out, let me tell you a story. I was recently making a few follow-up calls when I encountered a gentleman who seemed to be generally angry with life. A lot of things were said in the conversation that I could have reacted negatively to, but I decided to do something against that impulse.This gentleman was upset at me having called his elderly mother, who had expressed interest in selling her home with me. He insinuated I was harassing her, which obviously wasnât my intention. But instead of reacting with a negative attitude, I defended my position and asked him to help me understand his.I allowed the gentleman to explain his position, then de-escalated the situation by expressing empathy and solidarity. I offered to take him out of my database, apologized for the situation at hand, and ended the conversation.âYOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO REMAIN POSITIVE.âEven though I still felt slightly shaken up by what had just happened, I was able to step away from the situation knowing I chose not to let it get out of hand. We have this same choice in every interaction weâre a part of. You can and should always choose kindness. People may push our buttons, but you always have the choice to remain positive.Always remember that we have no way of knowing what another person is going through, so try to avoid falling into negative behavior.I know this isnât related to our usual topics, but I do think itâs important. So, take this message and apply it in your daily life.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or need help with any of your real estate needs, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Use our home evaluation tool.When you join our team and eXp Realty, you will have the opportunity to build wealth for you and your family.What do you get when you join eXp Realty?First of all, there are three different ways to make revenue just by selling real estate:Getting your commission. If you build a team, get a part of their deals as they do them until they cap out at $16,000. StockâeXp is a publicly traded company, so their stock is very valuable and always rising. You get stock when you close a deal and when you bring on a team member. If you decide to go to Icon status, your $16,000 cap is given back to you at the end of the year in company stocks, so basically, you are only paying them $5,000 in commission splits for the entire year. I can go over how this works in more detail on our one-on-one call.eXp Realty gives you 25 to 35 live hours of training every single week. You also have access to their digital campus, so you can get things done in a snap. I have been thoroughly impressed with how client-centric this company is.If youâre a small brokerage, you can come on over and keep your culture, your brand, your people, and your brick-and-mortar office. All you have to do is add âpowered by eXpâ on the bottom right. Again, we can talk about that later.These are just a few perks of joining eXp Realty. What exactly do you get when you join The McDaniel Callahan Team?For one, you will get access to our 90-day jumpstart system. Hereâs what that looks like:Youâll start with a system called â36 to Lifeâ with my good friend, Hank Avink. I coach with this system too, but I may not coach your session depending on scheduling. â36 to Lifeâ is usually $300, but with us, youâll only pay $36 for a month long program. That will be the best $36 youâve spent in your life. I guarantee that if you donât like it, youâll get your money back.Rockstar Conversations is an eight-week self-guided program.Rockstar Mastermind takes place every Monday morning. Matt and I get together at 9 a.m. to coach and train on a specific topic or issue. This information is hyperlocal to our area.After that, weâll move you to the E.R.S.

        "title": "What 10 Terms Should All First-Time Homebuyers Know?",
        "author": "Caitie Neal",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are 10 important terms you need to know if youâre buying a house for the first time.Looking to buy a Bay Area Home? Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.1. Fixed rate mortgage: This is a mortgage with a fixed rate during its term. If you have a 4.25% interest rate and a term of five, 10, 15, or 25 years, that means your rate wonât change unless you refinance.2. Adjustable rate mortgage (ARM): This is the opposite of a fixed rate mortgage. With an ARM, youâll have a shorter term (somewhere between five and 10 years), but once that term concludes, the rate will adjust based on the other interest rates the bank charge. This can get confusing, so I advise that you speak to a lender if youâd like more clarification.  Pre-qualified: This means you talk to a lender and give them all your paperwork (bank statements, tax documents, etc.) so they can verify whether youâre qualified to buy or not. If you make $10 an hour, youâre probably not qualified to buy a million-dollar home. If you make $1,000 an hour, you probably are.4. Conventional loans: This is one of those loans that typically carries with it a 30-year mortgage or something similar. There are many loan products out there, so if you donât have a high credit score, you generally wonât be able to qualify for a conventional loanâyou need a minimum 650 FICO credit score so apply. The average down payment for a first-time homebuyer is only 5%, though, so thereâs no need to worry.5. FHA loan: This is a great loan for anyone whoâs gone through some credit dings. The FHA stands for Federal Housing Administration. With this loan, you can put down a minimum of 3.5%. You will have to carry mortgage insurance, but you can take that off later down the road.âKNOW THESE TERMS BEFORE YOU BUY A HOUSE.â6. Appraisal: An appraisal is when a third-party company analyses your property and compares it to other comparable properties within a certain radius. The homeâs condition, style of property, lot size, and a variety of other factors are taken into consideration. If you offer $250,000 for the home and the appraisal comes in at $300,000, either the purchase price must come down or you have to put another $50,000 into the deal to make it work.7. Mortgage insurance: Mortgage insurance exists to protect the bank. If you donât want mortgage insurance, you need to put at least 20% down. If you donât put at least 20% down, youâll get anywhere from 0.03% to 1.15% mortgage insurance tacked on to your rate. There are ways around this, though, and plenty of programs out there that donât require you to use mortgage insurance.8. Closing costs: What you pay in closing costs depends on you and what third-party vendors you may have brought in for expenses, such as multiple different home inspections. You can expect your closing costs to be between 2% and 5% of your purchase price.9. Buying down your rate: If you have a certain credit score but you have a lot of cash, and you have a high interest rate because of that score, you can literally pay to buy a better interest rate.10. Escrow: Escrow means youâre at the signing table signing away! An escrow account is a locked account which holds the buyerâs deposit so the seller canât pull it out and the buyer canât spend it. The way itâs kept safe is through non-conflicting instructions from both the buyer and the seller regarding releasing that cash, usually when the deal ends.If you have any more questions about any of these terms or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

This may sound like a ridiculous question, but it actually isnât. If you think that living near a Starbucks has nothing to do with home value, you might be surprised by what Iâm about to tell you.Between 1997 and 2014, studies across America showed that homes within a quarter of a mile of a Starbucks increased in value by 96%.Letâs face it, not every coffee shop is going to increase home value. Dunkin Donuts just doesnât stack up.âDOES LIVING NEXT TO A STARBUCKS REALLY INCREASE YOUR HOME VALUE?âThis âStarbucks Effectâ has swept across the nation. Boston home values increased 45.4%, Philadelphia home values increased by 31%, and Washington D.C. home values increased by 29.6%.But living next to a Starbucks isnât the only way to put value into your home. A lot of people think updating the bathroom and the kitchen is the best way to go, but why not make a change that is going to add between 30% and 40% in value?Studies show that adding a media or specialty room can add a lot of value to your home.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.Setting goals and achieving them is an important part of life and business alike. But, why are goals important? Well, goals can act as a roadmap for where you want to go.However, before you can have success with your goals, you need to start with a strong foundation. Think of that foundation as your big âwhy.â Consider the reason you get up each morning and keep pushing toward your goals.This reason should always act as the base for how you move forward. For me, I think back on a very hard time in my life. In 2009 I went through bankruptcy, foreclosure, lost both of my houses, and had many other misfortunes. My âwhyâ is that I never want to go through that again.As a result, I work harder than ever before to make sure that Iâm constantly striving toward my goals.âALWAYS REMEMBER TO KEEP YOUR GOALS IN THE FOREFRONT OF YOUR MINDâThe next step in achieving your goals is considering and implementing your beliefs. Think about what you believe in and how that can help push you forward. If you believe in yourself, you can accomplish your goals. Having positive beliefs will make all the difference.Next, think about your daily habits. Having a routine that is conducive to success will be incredibly important.For me, I get up at the same time each day, hit the gym, meditate, and head into the office. If you find that youâre engaging in activities that donât benefit you or your goals, re-evaluate your position and try to alter your habits for a better future and a better you.At this point, consider STP (strategies, tactics and processes). These things are going to be the methods through which you achieve your goals. I work toward my goals by door-knocking, networking, and cold-calling to get more clients.Finally, always remember to keep your goals in the forefront of your mind. If you review your goals each day, your subconscious will bring the things you want.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.Iâm going to flip the script a little bit today. Instead of bringing you another market update or tips about upcoming local events: I want to answer a question that I get asked all the time by my clients, âWhy did you choose real estate as a career?âThe reason I do real estate is because itâs literally in my blood. Iâve been watching and listening to my father, Terry McDaniel, all my life. Iâve seen and heard him negotiate countless transactions, work long hours, and endure the grind of this business.When I got my driverâs license at age 16, I was so excited. I couldnât wait to get in the car with my dad, roll down the window, and crank the music up. It wasnât until I was already in the driverâs seat of his green Suburban that I realized that instead of being windows-down-music-up this was windows-up-A/C-on, with dad on the phone negotiating.âWE WANT TO BE THE ANTIDOTE TO THAT STIGMA OF THOUGHT.âI thought it was so lame at the time, but what I didnât realize is that it was the beginning of my training to become an agent. All through high school I helped my dad by going to open houses, stuffing letters, and attending real estate conferences. I didnât know it back then, but all that time he was grooming me to be the agent I am today. For that, Iâll always be grateful.Iâm going to continue doing this for a long time because I strongly believe that there needs to be people like us out there protecting people. There are so many people out there giving real estate a bad name. We want to be the antidote to that stigma.If you have any questions for me, Terry, Chris, Eileen, John, or anyone else on our team, weâre always here to answer them. Just give us a call or send us an email. Weâd love to hear from you and offer a helping hand.",

Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.Today I wanted to talk to you about the four mistakes that sellers make during negotiations:If you get an offer from a buyer that is exactly what you were looking for, **donât send back a counteroffer.** But, if the offer you receive is not to your preference, doing a slight or no-counter is a major problem.**Do not insist on selling the home as-is.** The home can be sold as-is per the contract, but do you really want to be that seller who rudely drives that point home to the buyer? They just want to buy a nice, safe home for their family. Give a little, get a little.&#8220;GIVE A LITTLE, GET A LITTLE.&#8221;**Do not be cheap.** Thereâs being financially frugal, and then thereâs being flat out cheap. I can understand you not wanting to replace or repair the nitpicky things like a burnt out lightbulb, but if you know the roof needs to be repaired and you have the funds to at least patch it, make that repair. You donât want something to come back to bite you later down the road.**Do not bombard other listing agents.** Do not call the other agents that showed the home to tell them youâve received an offer. Itâs just rude, and thereâs a reason that those other agents didnât put in an offer for your home. Focus on the ones who did put in an offer and leave the others alone.If you have any other questions for me about this topic or youâre looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Market conditions in the Bay Area are a little crazy right now. Today, Iâll check in on how Walnut Creek, Alamo, and Danville are doing.Looking to buy a Bay Area Home? Search all Bay Area homes for sale.Selling Your Bay Area Home? Use our home evaluation tool.Itâs time for your August 2017 real estate market update!First, I have an exciting giveaway to announce. If you send me a video topic that we have not done in the past, you get a chance to win one of four speakers. These shiny mobile speakers pair up with your phone so you can take them anywhere.Just give me a topic and claim your new speaker at our office!Now, back to your market update.The market is a little bit crazy right now and has shifted significantly over the last couple of months. Letâs see whatâs happening in Walnut Creek, Alamo, and Danville:Walnut Creekâs market has a 99% health score, which is great news. There are 170 homes on the market, the median price point is $692,000, and homes spend an average of 46 days on market before selling. That leaves us with 1.4 months of inventory, which means homes are flying off the market.That median sales price has dropped 6% over the last 30 days. The days on market increased 4.5% and listings are up 7% with 156 new listings on the market. There were 55 price reductions in our market, which is 11.3% of the market.So, prices are starting to come down and inventory is starting to go up in Walnut Creek, which is actually good news.In Alamo, the marketplace health score is 77%, which is still fairly healthy. There are 67 homes on market. The median price point is $2.95 millionâthat number is skewed a little thanks to a $36 million home thatâs sitting on the market. Still, prices are on the rise.âTHE MARKET HAS SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS.âAlamo homes are spending an average of 100 days on market, leaving us with 2.7 months of inventory. That means if no other homes came on the market, it would only take 2.7 months to sell all of the listings currently on our market.The median price point is up 16.9% and the average days on market is down 3.8%. Listings are up 21.8%. New listings increased by 9.1% with 67 new listings. 27 homes in the market had price reductions, which is a 35% increase.Since price reductions are up and days on market are down, Alamo needs a bigger shift in price reductions in order for the market to get back on track.Finally, whatâs happening right here in Danville? Our market has a health score of 97%. There are 80 homes for sale, the median price point is at $1.499 million, and homes spend an average of 80 days on market. That leaves us with 1.4 months of inventory.The median home price is down 1.7% over the last 30 days, and the average days on market is up 23.1%, which is interesting. There are 80 listings on the market, which is down 7% over the last 30 days. New listings are down 18.8%. Price reductions are also down 19.4% with 25 price reductions in the market.So, price reductions have gone down, the median price point has dropped, and homes are spending more time on the market. Buyers are telling us somethingâhome prices need to come down if we want houses to sell.Of course, this is just an overview of three different cities in the Bay Area. If you have any questions about your specific market, just give me a call or send me an email.Please donât hesitate to reach out to me with any questions in the meantime. I look forward to speaking with you!",
