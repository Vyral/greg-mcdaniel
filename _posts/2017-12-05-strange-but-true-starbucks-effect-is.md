Today I’ve got an interesting question to answer: Does living next to a Starbucks really increase your home value?

 Many of you might be wondering what I’m talking about. This may sound like a ridiculous question, but it actually isn’t. If you think that living near a Starbucks has nothing to do with home value, you might be surprised by what I’m about to tell you.

 Between 1997 and 2014, studies across America showed that **homes within a quarter of a mile of a Starbucks increased in value by 96%.**

 Let’s face it, not every coffee shop is going to increase home value. Dunkin Donuts just doesn’t stack up.

 This “Starbucks Effect” has swept across the nation. Boston home values increased 45.4%, Philadelphia home values increased by 31%, and Washington D.C. home values increased by 29.6%.

 But living next to a Starbucks isn’t the only way to put value into your home. A lot of people think updating the bathroom and the kitchen is the best way to go, but why not make a change that is going to add between 30% and 40% in value?

 **Studies show that adding a media or specialty room can add a lot of value to your home.**

 If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
