&nbsp;

If you’ve never heard of the San Francisco Institute of Aesthetic & Regenerative Medicine, I’m excited to take you on a quick tour of it to show you everything this private hospital/hotel has to offer.

Located in the heart of Union Square in the Penthouse Suite of the Westin St. Francis Hotel, **this is the only fully accredited surgical center in the area**. You can come in for surgery, stay at the hotel, and have all your subsequent medical needs taken care of in complete privacy. In fact, each patient is offered their own entrance, exit, and elevator.

They also have a beauty lab where you can test all of the beauty products they have for sale before you buy them, a clinical research room where they test the products before they come on the market, and several other facilities dedicated to aesthetic and regenerative medicine.
