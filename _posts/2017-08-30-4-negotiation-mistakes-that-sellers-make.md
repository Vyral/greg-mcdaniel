Today I wanted to talk to you about the four mistakes sellers make when trying to sell their homes.

Today I wanted to talk to you about the four mistakes that sellers make during negotiations:
<ol class="indent">
<li>If you get an offer from a buyer that is exactly what you were looking for, **don’t send back a counteroffer.** But, if the offer you receive is not to your preference, doing a slight or no-counter is a major problem.</li>

<li>**Do not insist on selling the home as-is.** The home can be sold as-is per the contract, but do you really want to be that seller who rudely drives that point home to the buyer? They just want to buy a nice, safe home for their family. Give a little, get a little.</li>

{% include pullquote.html %}

<li>**Do not be cheap.** There’s being financially frugal, and then there’s being flat out cheap. I can understand you not wanting to replace or repair the nitpicky things like a burnt out lightbulb, but if you know the roof needs to be repaired and you have the funds to at least patch it, make that repair. You don’t want something to come back to bite you later down the road.</li>

<li>**Do not bombard other listing agents.** Do not call the other agents that showed the home to tell them you’ve received an offer. It’s just rude, and there’s a reason that those other agents didn’t put in an offer for your home. Focus on the ones who did put in an offer and leave the others alone.</li>
</ol>

If you have any other questions for me about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call. We’d be happy to help!
