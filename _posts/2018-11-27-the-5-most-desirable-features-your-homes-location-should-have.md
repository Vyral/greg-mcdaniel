We’ve all heard that location is the most important thing in real estate whether you’re buying or selling, but if you’re a buyer, there are five aspects of your home’s location that will give you the best possible return on your investment when it’s time to sell:

**1. A safe surrounding neighborhood**. You want to live in a place where you’d feel comfortable leaving your doors unlocked at night.

 **2. Quality nearby schools**. Investing in a home in a good school district is always a better idea than investing in a home in a so-so school district, because the former will only appreciate in value. People will pay a premium to enroll their kids into the best schools possible.

**3. Close proximity to shopping centers, restaurants, bars, etc**. My office is in Westside Danville, and home sellers in this area command a high price because downtown is within walking distance.

**4. A good view or access to water**. People will pay for a quality view, so if your home’s located on a waterway or on a hill with a panoramic view, that’s what you call a “million-dollar view.”

**5. Quick access to public transportation and/or any major roads and freeways**. The freeway shouldn’t be bordering your backyard, but if you can get there in a few minutes from your home, that’s a big plus. In fact, that’s one of the reasons I bought my home—I can get on I-680 or I-24 in no time at all.

Now that we know the most desirable locational features, what are some of the least desirable? Generally, you don’t want your home to be located right next to any hospitals, airports, or schools. If it’s next to a hospital, you risk hearing ambulances drive by your house at all hours of the night. If it’s next to an airport, you might hear jumbo jets landing 24/7. If it’s right next to a school, you might have to hear parents dropping off and picking up their kids nine months out of the year.
