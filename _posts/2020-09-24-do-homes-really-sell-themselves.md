<center><em>Homes don't sell themselves, and I'll share why.</em></center>

<br>Sellers often tell me that the home just sells itself, but that’s just not how real estate works. Here’s why:

We all think our house is the prettiest with the best upgrades and the best location. However, in reality, my job as a real estate professional that you’ve hired to get the highest and best price is also to expose your listing to the most buyers possible. Further, I need to mitigate and wrangle in my client’s expectations.

Yes, your home has a ton of value; everyone’s home does. However, most homes are not going to sell themselves, and **that’s when our team’s marketing skills using video and social media extensively help homes sell faster**. That brings up another point: We need your help as sellers to identify all the major points about your home that we’re not aware of so we can help you sell your home quickly.
