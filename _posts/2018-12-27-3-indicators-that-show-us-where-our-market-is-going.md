Here are the three signs that tell us whether 2019 is going to be a hot market or not:

**1. Existing home sales**. In the last several months, we’ve seen an uptick of 1.4% in our existing home sales. Overall, we’re still down 5.1% for the year, according to the National Association of Realtors. After six consecutive months of decline, buyers are finally stepping back into the housing market, which gives us hope for 2019. A lot of folks didn’t buy in 2018, but as wages increase and consumer health continues, we’re very optimistic for 2019.

**2. Housing units authorized, but not yet started**. What we’re discussing here is new home construction. This is an incredibly powerful indicator. As we discussed earlier, 2018’s existing home sales have been challenged and that has driven the prices up nationally for all home sales. There are 170,000 new homes ready to be built in 2019. This is a level we haven't seen in a decade. Once homes hit the market, there will be a needed growth of inventory, which will bring more sales.

**3. Real disposable personal income**. This is not typically a real estate indicator, but with housing affordability becoming such an issue, disposable income has really jumped to the forefront as an indicator of what’s to happen in the future—not only in your home and with your personal livelihood, but with new home sales and new construction.

If this has been helpful to you, feel free to share it with a friend or family member. If you have any other real estate questions for me or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in 2019, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
