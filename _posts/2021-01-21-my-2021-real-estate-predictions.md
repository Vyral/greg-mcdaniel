<br>Today I’m sharing some quick real estate predictions for 2021. What is this crazy market going to look like, and are we going to survive it? I say we will.

There’s been a bunch of talk from mortgage professionals recently that **interest rates are expected to stay in the low 2% range**. That means plenty of buying power if you’re considering purchasing this year.

There has also been tons of talk about many people moving out of major metropolitan areas, like San Francisco. We’ve seen a 25% to 30% decrease in rental rates and a slew of people vacating the area. To be honest, I don’t know what this will mean for home sales. What I can tell you is that a lot of people are making major life shifts. So many people are moving to the suburbs or rural neighborhoods.

**This year will be a little crazy** because we don’t know what’s coming down the pike, but my team and I will be here to help with whatever you need.

If you have any questions about real estate or want to discuss theories or concerns, give us a call or send an email. We can also come out to give you a home evaluation and talk about what the best move would be for you. We would love to help you.
