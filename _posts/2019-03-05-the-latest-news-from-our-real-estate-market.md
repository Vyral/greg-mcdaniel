<center><em>I&rsquo;ve got an update for you on our real estate market, straight from my recent seller seminar. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</em></center>

&nbsp;

I recently hosted a seminar for home sellers and I wanted to share a clip of it with you today. **I talked about the current state of the market, what’s causing the market shift, and more**.

So, what is the market doing right now? If you look at the statewide sales, they’re down about 5.5% year over year. **We started to see this happen in August of last year**. My father, who has been in the business for 47 years, was the one who found this anomaly.

Our price growth has also been slowing down, but this needed to take place. **The six years of appreciation we’ve seen has been great, but it’s important to realize that our market is different than the rest of the country**. The rest of the country will see a steady incline or steady decline. We, on the other hand, see hard ups, hard downs, moderates ups, hard downs, big ups. It’s always shifting and changing.

That’s not always a bad thing either. In other parts of the country, homes are worth a lot less than they are here. They do see steady appreciation of like 3% each year, but 3% on a $180,000 home is a lot different than 3% on a $800,000 home.

What’s contributing to our slow down right now? Buyers got tired of getting beaten up by sellers and they just threw their hands up. Interest rates rose a little bit and we saw an instant freeze in the market. When rates went up, prices stalled out, especially in the upper price ranges. **The affordability in that price point is very thin**. At the same time, the $600,000 to $1 million market is seeing homes flying off the shelves.

If you have any questions for me about the current state of the market or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
