Now that we’re into November, the holiday season is upon us, and there are some fun events we want to give you the lowdown on for the upcoming month. I’ve provided links for each event so you can find out more details and get your tickets early.

**First up, we have the [Bacon & Beer Classic](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/san-francisco-bacon-and-beer-classic-tickets-48891682338){: target="_blank"}** on November 10 at AT&T Park from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. If you like beer and bacon, this event is a no-brainer. There will be over 100 craft beers available to sample and more than 30 dishes with bacon-infused recipes cooked up by local chefs.

**Next, we have the [Chocolate and Art Show](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/chocolate-and-art-show-san-francisco-november-15-16-2018-tickets-44691771291){: target="_blank"}** on November 15 and 16 at the Soma Cultural Center. From 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. on both days, you’ll be able to see some of San Francisco’s best up-and-coming artists and sample some great free chocolate.

**Our third event is one of my absolute favorites—the [61st Annual San Francisco Chronicle Auto Show](https://www.sfautoshow.com/){: target="_blank"}**, which is happening from November 21 through November 25 at the Moscone Center. If you’ve never been before, you have to check it out, and if you’re a car enthusiast, you simply can’t miss it. Each day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., you’ll see all kinds of cool cars.

**Next up is the [San Rafael Parade of Light and Winter Wonderland](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-san-rafael-39th-annual-parade-of-lights-and-winter-wonderland-tickets-42573052145){: target="_blank"}** on November 23 from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. At this family-friendly event, you’ll get to enjoy the holiday marketplace and see all kinds of arts and crafts, not to mention plenty of entertainment for all ages. You’ll also get to see one of the largest holiday parades in the entire Bay Area.

**The last event is an absolute staple here in the Bay Area—the [Union Square Christmas Tree Lighting](https://www.sftourismtips.com/union-square-christmas-tree-lighting.html){: target="_blank"}**. This will be held on November 23 at Union Square from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. The event actually starts closer to 5:30 p.m. and they don’t light the tree until usually around 6:50 p.m., so since it’s Black Friday, you’ll have the opportunity to shop and really get into the spirit of Christmas.

As always, I hope you have time to check out these awesome events. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, real estate or otherwise, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
