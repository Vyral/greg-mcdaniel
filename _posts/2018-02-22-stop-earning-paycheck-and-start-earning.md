When you join our team and eXp Realty, you will have the opportunity to build wealth for you and your family.

What do you get when you join eXp Realty?

First of all, there are three different ways to make revenue just by selling real estate:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Getting your commission. </li>
<li>If you build a team, get a part of their deals as they do them until they cap out at $16,000. </li>
<li>Stock—eXp is a publicly traded company, so their stock is very valuable and always rising. You get stock when you close a deal and when you bring on a team member. If you decide to go to Icon status, your $16,000 cap is given back to you at the end of the year in company stocks, so basically, you are only paying them $5,000 in commission splits for the entire year. I can go over how this works in more detail on our one-on-one call.</li>
</ol>

**eXp Realty gives you 25 to 35 live hours of training every single week.** You also have access to their digital campus, so you can get things done in a snap. I have been thoroughly impressed with how client-centric this company is.

If you’re a small brokerage, you can come on over and keep your culture, your brand, your people, and your brick-and-mortar office. All you have to do is add “powered by eXp” on the bottom right. Again, we can talk about that later.

These are just a few perks of joining eXp Realty. **What exactly do you get when you join The McDaniel Callahan Team?**

For one, you will get access to our 90-day jumpstart system. Here’s what that looks like:
<ol class="indent">
<li>You’ll start with a system called “36 to Life” with my good friend, Hank Avink. I coach with this system too, but I may not coach your session depending on scheduling. “36 to Life” is usually $300, but with us, you’ll only pay $36 for a month long program. That will be the best $36 you’ve spent in your life. I guarantee that if you don’t like it, you’ll get your money back.</li>
<li>Rockstar Conversations is an eight-week self-guided program.</li>
<li>Rockstar Mastermind takes place every Monday morning. Matt and I get together at 9 a.m. to coach and train on a specific topic or issue. This information is hyperlocal to our area.
After that, we’ll move you to the E.R.S. Livestream with Jeff Cohn. **Jeff is a real estate powerhouse based out of Omaha, Nebraska, and he has opened his coaching sessions up for free to all of our team members** on Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 a.m. Pacific Standard time. Jeff’s team did 750 deals last year and, as of this recording, he’s on track to do 1,000 deals in 2018. You can learn a lot from him.</li>
</ol>

Matt and I will also do monthly Q&A calls and potentially bring in guests to cover specific topics. You can also book time on my personal calendar if there is anything you want to talk to me about.

You also have access to any of our team’s products, such as the Rockstar Conversations, our high-tech, high-touch farming product (eight to 12 hours of farming content), and The Introvert’s Guide to Real Estate Success. If you don’t like being out in front of people, this is a guide we put together with Dr. Debra Dupree, a psychologist here in San Diego. She breaks down how you can be an introvert and succeed and thrive in real estate.

Our next upcoming product is called “How to Find Your Next Client Using Facebook Live.”

If you are interested in learning more about this opportunity, go to <a href="https://calendly.com/mcdaniel-44/" target="_blank">BookMcDaniel.com</a> to book a 30-minute talk with me to see if this is a good fit for you. If it is, great! If not, that’s fine, too.

I want to give you the opportunity to do more than earn a paycheck in real estate. I want to help you start building wealth for you and your family.

If you do decide to do this, I’ll run some numbers to show you how this compounds in a short amount of time. You can literally get mailbox money by adding five, 10, 15, or 25 people from anywhere in the country to your team.

Again, go to <a href="https://calendly.com/mcdaniel-44/" target="_blank">BookMcDaniel.com</a> to schedule a 30-minute talk with me. I look forward to hearing from you!
