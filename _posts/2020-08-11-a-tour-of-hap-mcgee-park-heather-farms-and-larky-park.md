<center><em>Realtors do more than just help you buy and sell&mdash;let&rsquo;s go on a tour of my three favorite parks.</em></center>

<br>Allow me to take you on a tour of my three favorite parks in Danville, Walnut Creek, and Pleasant Hill to show you the beauty and utility of these spaces.

&nbsp;I’ll provide some information about these areas below; for the full tour, refer to the video above\! You can also use the timestamps below to navigate the tour at your leisure.

**0:25 — Located in Danville, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.danville.ca.gov/613/Hap-Magee-Ranch-Park">Hap McGee Park</a></u> is a 17-acre parcel of land that was originally used as a summer camp for orphans from San Francisco**. Later, it transformed into a cattle ranch for longhorn steers. Now, it’s a great big park where everyone can gather. There is a lot of neat, old architecture to appreciate, as well as a large play yard and dog park.

**2:10 — Located on the east side of Walnut Creek, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.walnut-creek.org/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/51/665">Heather Farms</a></u> is the biggest, coolest park in the area**. This amazing park has 102 acres of land, and they have all the amenities you could want in a park: a swim area, a play yard, areas for barbecuing, a fishing lake, tennis courts, a skate park, upwards of six soccer and baseball fields, as well as a dog park and horse facility.

**8:25 — Here in Pleasant Hill, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.walnut-creek.org/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/56/665?npage=2&amp;selamenityid=75">Larky Park</a></u> is smaller than Heather Farms**, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do for the whole family\! At Larky, you’ll find a swimming pool, an area to play horseshoes, a play area for the kids, and places to barbecue. One really cool aspect of this park is that it’s the seat of the Lindsay Wildlife Experience, where you can go to learn about different animals. They have many live animals on-site that were injured or are in the process of rehabilitation. They also have an emergency vet clinic; a few months ago, I found an injured hummingbird and brought it to them. Hope the little guy is okay\!

Today’s tour is a prime example of why you don' t have to contact your Realtor only when you need to buy or sell. You can also reach out to us to learn about interesting places you might not have heard of or visited, which is especially useful for those who are just moving to the area.

If you have any questions or would like more suggestions for great places to take your family in the Danville area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to share my top destinations with you.
