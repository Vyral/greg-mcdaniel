What’s the difference between a pre-approval and a pre-qualification? Today I’m joined by Miles Palacios of CMG Mortgage to answer that question.

With a pre-qualification, you share certain financial information with a lender (your annual income, assets, etc.) and they check your credit. The process is very informal, though, and they don’t verify any documentation. With a pre-approval, you actually supply your documentation to a lender that they then verify.

So, should you try a pre-qualification or go straight to the pre-approval? In Miles’ opinion, **a pre-qualification isn’t as beneficial as a pre-approval because it’s not as exacting**. Oftentimes, people don’t even know how much their annual income is or what their specific debts are.
