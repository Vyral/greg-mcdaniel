Today I’ll expand your knowledge of real estate by treating you to a range of facts and trivia related to the industry. Quiz your friends, family, and co-workers by showing off what you learn here!

**1. McDonald’s**. This restaurant chain is one of America’s biggest to ever exist. A lot of people think that the franchise is just about burger flipping and unhealthy eating, but that’s actually not the case. McDonald’s is one of the biggest real estate portfolio holders in the commercial sector. The franchisees own the building and oversee the business that a particular restaurant brings in, but [McDonald’s as a corporation owns the land](https://blog.wallstreetsurvivor.com/2015/10/08/mcdonalds-beyond-the-burger/){: target="_blank"}.

**2. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha**. Warren Buffett is currently considered the [third richest person in the world](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#1bf05b5f251c){: target="_blank"}, according to Forbes magazine. Here’s a fun fact about Mr. Buffett: He currently still lives in his Omaha, Nebraska home that he originally purchased way back in 1958 for a meager $31,500.

**3. Brass door knobs**. Though many people look down on those who purposefully have brass door knobs in their homes, maybe that’s a prejudice to reconsider: Brass door knobs are antibacterial, meaning they disinfect themselves. Other metals like aluminum, iron, lead, silver, also share this quality. On that note, here’s your term of the day: the [oligodynamic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodynamic_effect){: target="_blank"}.

**4. The red doors of Scotland**. We all like to put our own personal touches on our homes, but in Scotland, having a red door means something pretty specific—it means [that homeowner has fully paid off their mortgage](http://www.npdodge.com/blog/2015/10/the-tradition-of-painting-a-front-door-red-what-does-it-mean/){: target="_blank"}! What color is your front door?

**5. Trading a paperclip for a house**. I once heard the story of a person who traded a red paperclip for a house, but I wasn’t initially sure it was true. As it turns out, it was! The gentleman in question started a red paperclip contest, in which he offered up a red paperclip online to trade for something bigger and better. [After one year and 14 trades later, he ended up with a house in Saskatchewan](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/from-paper-clip-to-house-in-14-trades-1.573973){: target="_blank"}! Why don’t we have more red paperclips!?

**6. Charles “Pretty Boy” Floyd**. [“Pretty Boy” Floyd](http://time.com/3518207/pretty-boy-floyd/){: target="_blank"} was a notorious gangster back in the 1930s, and a bank robber to boot. However, he was regarded favorably by the public. But why? Well, when Pretty Boy would go into a bank to take their money, he would also take mortgage documents, freeing a number of citizens from debt.

**7. Monopoly**. Board games have traditionally been a popular way for families to pass the time, but did you know that the board game Monopoly (initially created by a woman named Lizzie Magie and eventually picked up by the Parker Brothers) was [originally designed to teach players about the broken nature of capitalism](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monopoly-was-designed-teach-99-about-income-inequality-180953630/){: target="_blank"}? I sure didn’t!

**8. India’s $1 billion property**. Owned by Mukesh Ambani in South Mumbai, India, [Antilia is the most expensive, privately owned residence in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/antilia-mumbai-most-expensive-house-mukesh-ambani-2012-5){: target="_blank"} (after Buckingham Palace in the U.K.; however, that is owned by the British Crown, so it isn’t privately owned). Antilia has 27 habitable floors, six of which are just for parking (these parking floors can hold 168 vehicles!).

**9. Ghosts in the legal machine**. Did you know that in New York, when a home is under investigation regarding the seller’s disclosures, you are legally required to disclose if you believe that your home is haunted by ghosts? We definitely don’t do that in California. For a rundown about how to approach a home sale with a haunted house, [click here](https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/selling-haunted-house-disclosure/){: target="_blank"}. For the full details on the legal case that actually inspired this law, [check out this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stambovsky_v._Ackley){: target="_blank"} on the fascinating Stambovsky v. Ackley case.

**10. The tallest building in the world**. The Burj Khalifa, located in the United Arab Emirates, surpassed the Taipei 101 in height in 2007, making it officially the tallest building in the world. This building has [several other records to its name](http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/the-tower/factsandfigures.aspx){: target="_blank"}, as well, including the world’s tallest freestanding structure, the building with the most floors, and the tallest man-made structure. If you stood at the base of the Burj Khalifa and watched the sunset, you could then go to the very top of the building and watch the sunset again—it’s that tall.

**11. Building a skyscraper in 15 days**. Using prefabricated modules, some builders in China are able to build a 30-story skyscraper [in about 15 days](https://www.wired.com/2012/09/broad-sustainable-building-instant-skyscraper/){: target="_blank"}!
