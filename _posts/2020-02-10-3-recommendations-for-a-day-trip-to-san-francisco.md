<center><em>Follow me as I tour three of San Francisco&rsquo;s most iconic destinations.</em></center>

<br>Whether you’re interested in art, the outdoors, great food, or all of the above, San Francisco has something for everyone. Today I’ll walk you through a list of some great spots to check out when you’re in the Marina District.

**Feel free to follow along with me in the video above as I tour three must-visit destinations in San Francisco, or use the timestamps below to navigate the tour at your leisure and see some great clips of each hotspot:**

1:36 - **Pier 39**, one of San Francisco’s biggest attractions, has a 45-acre complex that boasts 15 restaurants, more than 90 stores, a 300-berthing arena where you can park your boat, and a five-acre park along the water.

3:34 - Designed in 1917 and built in 1933, the **Golden Gate Bridge** is an iconic feature of the Bay Area and one of the largest suspension bridges in the world. Because of the saltwater in the bay, the bridge must be continually repainted.

4:37 - **The Palace of Fine Arts** is a 17-acre parcel built to exhibit big pieces of art. It’s a great gathering place, and on any given weekend, you might see a few people getting married here\!

I had a blast touring these key destinations in San Francisco, and I hope you enjoy your trip when you take it as much as I did\!

As always, if you have any questions about real estate or great tips for the city, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send an email. I’d be happy to answer your questions and recommend some awesome stops to check out.
