<br>We’re continuing on in our mythbusting series after addressing selling myth No. 1: <u><a target="_blank" href="https://mcdanielcallahanblog.com/do-sellers-set-the-sales-price.html">The sales price is set by the seller</a></u>. We’re analyzing myth No. 2 out of 15 today, and it has to do with the effect pricing has on a home sale.

Our myth today: Overpricing a home results in higher sales prices. This one is absolutely false, and in fact, **the trend among sellers in our area is to do the exact opposite**. In some parts of the Bay Area, people will actually dramatically underprice their homes so as to attract a large amount of buyers to the property and get the bids up.

In the peninsula, parts of Oakland, and the South Bay—not so much here in the East Bay—folks will price their home 15% to 30% below market value to generate interest and get buyers to push over and above the listing price.

On the other hand, **if you overprice your home, you’re most likely to sit there on the market and become sour and stale**.

Stay on the lookout for our next video, where we tackle myth No. 3: Overpricing a property leads to extra room for negotiation.
