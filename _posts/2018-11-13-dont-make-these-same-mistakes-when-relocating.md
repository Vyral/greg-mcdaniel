Are you thinking about relocating? Here are six big mistakes you need to avoid:

**1. Listing your home before deciding where to go**. What if you actually get a buyer and you still have no place to go?

**2. Buying a home before selling your existing home**. A lot of people can’t afford to do this, so make sure you list with the right agent so you can buy your next home in the proper order.

**3. Not troubleshooting your finances ahead of time**. This point ties in with the previous one. Before you buy your second home, you need to make sure you can afford to buy it. In addition to hiring the right agent, make sure you meet with a good CPA and a good lender so that the dollars and cents add up to the proper amount.

**4. Renting out your old home before considering all the factors**. There’s no going back when your renters sign their part of the contract, so make sure you consider all the variables of the area you’re moving to before you rent out your old house.&nbsp;

**5. Not researching the schools in your area before you move**. You want to make sure your kids get into the best school possible, so be sure to research the schools in your area so they get the best education for their future.&nbsp;

**6. Assuming all of your belongings will arrive on time**. Be proactive, not reactive. Check with your moving company and make sure your furniture and all of your other belongings are scheduled to arrive on the right day.&nbsp;

Remember, these are the six biggest things that could potentially go wrong during a relocation, so if you have any other questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
