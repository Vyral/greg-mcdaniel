<center><em>Think you can rely on online home valuations? Think again.</em></center>

<br>Some sellers seem to think that online home valuations are accurate and can be trusted. Here’s why that’s a myth.

Even Zillow, one of the most popular sites to get an online home valuation, says in their disclosures that their Zestimates are a guess. **They’ve had valuations that range from 62% to 256% off the mark**.

At best, these online valuations are just ballpark estimates to help you get a start, but they’re not actual evaluations. To get a real measure of your home’s value, we need to take a look at the house itself, including the yard, finishes, amenities, additions, surrounding perks, and more. All of these factor into your home’s true market value.

Bottom line: When it comes to getting a real valuation, don’t confuse your Zestimate or other online valuation with my real estate license and nearly 20 years in the business. **If you want a true valuation of your home, talk to a professional agent**.
