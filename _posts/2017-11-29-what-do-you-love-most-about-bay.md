Today, we’re doing something completely different from what we’ve done in the past. I’m excited to announce this new series on why we all love to live in the Bay area.
 Of course, everyone has different reasons for why they love to live here so much, but today I’d like to mention just a few of these points.

The aim of this series is to create an interactive dialogue between myself and all of you about the Bay area. **I want to know what locations, restaurants, and features in our area you love the most and why.** Whether your favorite thing about living here is a particular beach, a certain hiking trail, or even just a special view, I want to hear about it.

For now, I want to let you in on a few of my own favorite things about the Bay. First, I love how centrally located we are. In just a few hours or less, I can go almost anywhere and do nearly anything I want.

As an example, I live just about 45 minutes to an hour away from Napa. I’m also just three hours from Lake Tahoe and 45 minutes to San Francisco. The list goes on and on.

 With all of the opportunities the Bay has to offer, how could anyone not love living here? The diversity of the Bay area is one feature that absolutely captured my heart from the moment I first moved here in the second grade.

 **Some of our nation’s most iconic landmarks are right in our backyard.** From the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge and beyond, there is no shortage of things to see.

 And let’s not forget about the active sports world here in our area. We’ve got the Giants, the Raiders, the 49ers, the Sharks, and so much more.

**I could go on and on, but I want to hear from you.** What do you love most about living in the Bay? If you send me a video or some audio, I’ll put it right here on the air. You can also simply write down your response for me to read aloud.

 If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
