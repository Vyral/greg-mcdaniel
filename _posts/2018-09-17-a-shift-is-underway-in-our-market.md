Here are some of the latest statistics from our market and what they mean for you:

* The average days on market is 45 days, while the median is 30 days.
* The average list price is $1.63 million.
* The median sale price is $1.3 million.
* The lowest listing is $298,000, while the highest is $39 million.

At the beginning of the year, the average days on market was 17 days, so we’ve seen a significant uptick since then. **We’re also seeing a significant shift in terms of pricing**. The average list price in the 68 Corridor is $1,142,524 million, while the average sale price is $1,160,757. Although that’s a good-looking list-to-sale price difference, we’re still experiencing a slowdown, and I’m really kind of terrified to see where that’s going.

**If you’re thinking about listing your home, get into the market and list your property now**. We’re seeing either complete stagnation or price reductions from other listings across the board. Even in the more affordable price ranges, we’re seeing price reductions of as much as $50,000, which can really hurt you in terms of the equity you were planning on getting from your home sale.

Whether you’re thinking of selling or buying a property soon in our market, I’d love to help you, so don’t hesitate to give me a call so we can get started. I look forward to hearing from you.
