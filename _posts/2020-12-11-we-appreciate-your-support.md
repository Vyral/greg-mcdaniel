<center><em>A giant thank-you to you all, and keep us in mind if you need help in 2021.</em></center>

<br>It’s the end of 2020, and it’s been a dumpster fire of a year\! However, we’re ending on a great note.

Today I wanted to take a little time to say how much we appreciate every one of you. We care about all you guys; this year has been difficult on so many different levels, and everything’s come at us. However, **each of you is a survivor** because you’re here watching or reading this, you made it through, and you tried to stay positive. Thank you so much for watching my videos all year.

I also want to give a double high-five to my team at <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.getvyral.com/official-real-estate-messages">Vyral Marketing</a></u>; they do an excellent job of putting together all my clips, and my coach Paul hangs out with me every Friday when I shoot these videos.

When we cross the threshold of 2021, I would love you to **keep our team in mind for any real estate needs you may have or if you just have a question we can answer**. If you need a resource or referral, contact us; you don’t only have to reach out about real estate—we can help you find the best painter, handyman, gardener, financial advisor, and more. We’re well-connected, and we’d be glad to assist you in any way, shape, or form.

If there’s anything we can do for you, reach out via phone or email. If you just want to say hi, please do. Keep watching the videos, know we care about you, and have a blessed, powerful, and exceptional rest of 2020. Make 2021 the most fantastic year of your life\!
