<br>Today is myth No. 5 in our 15-part series on home-selling myths you need to stop believing: A quick offer means the property is priced too low. Wrong\!

What that really means is that, ahead of time, the real estate agent and homeowner should have gone over their intentions: what the expectations are, what the timeline is, what’s most essential, and how the agent can serve the seller best. So a quick offer means the home was priced properly. It doesn’t mean we’re giving the house away or it’s undervalued.

**A home will never sell under the market value**. How can that be true? Well, I’ve never seen a house sell under market value because market value is what a buyer is willing and able to pay for the home. Market values are set by buyers in that market. Remember: Market value and list price aren’t always the same.

If you have any questions about this myth or real estate in general, please reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to help you.
