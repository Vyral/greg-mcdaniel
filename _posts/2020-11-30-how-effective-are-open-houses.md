<br>**Update:** The original video here was filmed in January of 2020. Obviously, things have changed since then. To accommodate COVID-19 precautions, we're doing digital open houses, scheduling buyers further apart, and streaming live walkthroughs on Facebook and Instagram.

What percentage of home sales do you think result directly from an open house event? **According to the National Association of Realtors, only 2% of home sales actually come through an open house**. It’s great to showcase your property, but doing so means you’ll have to go somewhere else and find a way to occupy three hours while you let strangers pass in and out of your home. Open houses are inherently inconvenient, but thankfully the truth behind this myth will set you free.

Exposing your home to the marketplace and having folks walk through it with another licensed real estate agent is fantastic, but you don’t need to have an open house every weekend. Instead, do a couple of strategic open houses to create a bit of a buzz in the market, but then pull back and rely primarily on your real estate agent’s marketing.

Here at the McDaniel Callahan Team, we’ve held a lot of open houses and found them to be very effective for general meeting and greeting; in all honesty, it’s a great way for us to source new buyer clients in the market. However, **if you’re selling and don’t want to open your home for three hours on Sundays, don’t fret**—it’s generally not going to impact the viewership and visibility of your home.
