&nbsp;

As of this August, I have been bringing you informative videos about our market for four full years. With that in mind, I want to ask you a simple question: Do you hate me?

Of course I’m joking, but the reason I ask is, even after all of this time, some of you have still never reached out. Don’t get me wrong—I understand how busy things can get. In fact, that’s one of the major reasons I do what I do. I want to serve as a convenient resource for all your real estate needs, and today I’d like to offer you something else.&nbsp;

How would you like to go on vacation? &nbsp;Well, now is your chance. All you need to do is visit [McDanielCallahanVacation.com](www.mcdanielcallahanvacation.com) to book your stay. Up to two adults and two children can register, so I encourage you and your family to take advantage of this great opportunity. If you cover airfare and the tax for your hotel rooms, I’ll pay for the rest of any resort package you choose.

After following the instructions on our website and reading the terms and conditions, you and your family will be all set to let the worries of the world wash away.

If you do take advantage of this opportunity, be sure to tag our team in any photos you post. We would love to see how you and your loved ones spent your vacation.

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
