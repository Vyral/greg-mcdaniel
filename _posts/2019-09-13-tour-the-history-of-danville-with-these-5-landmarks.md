<center><em>The city of Danville has a rich history, and today we&rsquo;ll explore its most important landmarks.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Today I invite you to follow along with me in the video above as I take a tour of the top five historical landmarks of the city of Danville:

**1\. The Danville Oak Tree (1:04):** This tree is estimated to be over 350 years old, and it’s the most iconic landmark in Danville. You can find it on Diablo Road—it’s the only tree supported by a metal brace.

**2\. The Museum of the San Ramon Valley (1:24):** Also known as the Danville Depot, this place was established as the first stop in the Southern Pacific Railway on July 7, 1891. Right behind the museum is where the train used to run, and all the farmers who were able to build their businesses next to the railway were able to ship their goods in all types of weather. I highly recommend visiting this museum if you’d like to know more about the history of the Valley.

**3\. The Veterans Memorial Building (1:59):** Built in 1925 for just $18,000, it’s been the center of veteran affairs for 80+ years. In 2010, the building underwent an extensive renovation and expansion. Underneath the flagpole on the outside of the building you’ll find several commemorative plaques that are perfect for a midday read on a sunny day.

**4\. Elliot’s Bar (2:32):** This bar was built in 1907 and moved to its current location in 1912. During Prohibition, it was converted into an ice cream parlor. It’s a great place to stop in and enjoy a cold beer.

**5\. St. Isidore’s Catholic Church (3:12):** Founded in 1910, this church was the first to serve the Danville parish, and it’s now a staple of the community.

Remember, if you have any real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
