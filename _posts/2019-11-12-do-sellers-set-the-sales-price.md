<center><em>Today marks the launch of my new series on home selling myths. Let&rsquo;s discuss myth No. 1.</em></center>

<br>Today, I’m excited to launch my brand-new series on the 15 home selling myths you need to stop believing. For our first installment, we’re going to be discussing a very common misconception—that sellers set the sales price.

**What really determines this figure is the home’s condition and location, as well as the condition of the market**. But, above even these factors, there is one more component that matters above all others: a buyer’s willingness to pay. That’s right—if a buyer isn’t willing to pay the list price you’ve set, then you probably aren’t going to get that amount.

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Also, stay tuned for part two of this series\!
