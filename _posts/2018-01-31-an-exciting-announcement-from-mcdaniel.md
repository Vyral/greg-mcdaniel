I’ve got big news for you and for us today. We are ecstatic to announce the fact that we’ve made a shift over to a new brokerage called exp Realty.

This is the fastest-growing national brokerage in the country. They went from 3,000 agents to over 6,500 in just the last year. eXp Realty is a tech-based real estate brokerage that has so many different amazing tools that will allow us to help you get your home seen and sold faster and for higher prices. **The technology and the personnel over at eXp have been simply amazing.** They have been able to get us everything we want and need in a timely manner and it’s a great environment to be around.

I also wanted to make sure and let you guys know why we shifted. The future is digital, it’s remote, and a lot of the brick and mortar businesses won’t be around. The mindset of the average human will be digitally-based (if it isn’t already), so we took the leap ahead of time so that we can help grow our team nationally and locally here in Alamo.

**If you’re an agent and want to learn about what value we can bring to you, we have a laundry list of goodness to share with you to help you put more money in your pockets.** There are three revenue streams with eXp Realty (and you get stock since they are a publicly traded company).

 If you have any questions for us about joining our team or need any assistance in reaching your real estate goals, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. Also, if you are interested in joining our team or learning more about why we switched, visit <a href="https://calendly.com/mcdaniel-44/" target="_blank">www.bookmcdaniel.com</a>. I would love to help you out.
