Check out this awesome property in Concord. The house is under contract, but it’s so great I wanted to share it with you anyway.

Today, I want to take you on a tour of <a href="https://www.trulia.com/p/ca/concord/2427-sycamore-ave-concord-ca-94520--2083283947" target="_blank">one of our properties</a>.

 Just a heads up that the sale is pending on this property; we sold it in seven days for 100% of the listing price.

This is a 3-bed, 1-bath, 1,200 sq. ft. home with one of the best kitchens I’ve seen in a long time. The house is located right in downtown Concord. **You can walk to Mount Diablo High School or walk to downtown Concord for food or events.** This is a quiet, one-way street, and you’re right next to the John Muir Medical Center as well.

Check out the video above for a complete tour of the house.

We did take out a fence to open up the front yard and give the house a new look. The interior features hardwood floors, a nice, open floor plan, and a great fireplace. Make sure you watch the video to check out that kitchen, which even comes with a prep sink.

The garage was converted into a great master bedroom suite with vaulted ceilings and a skylight. The backyard is big enough to play an NFL football game, and there is a side yard with a well, which is great for gardeners.

 There is also an outdoor structure that could be used as an office, as well as two structures for storage. **You could easily install a pool in the backyard next to the orange trees without losing a lot of space.**

 Like I mentioned earlier, this house is currently under contract. Stay tuned for more great properties, or reach out to me if you would like us to sell your home as fast as we sold this one.

 As always, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
