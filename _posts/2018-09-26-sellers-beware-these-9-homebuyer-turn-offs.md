&nbsp;

There are nine silly little things you could be unknowingly doing that will sabotage the sale of your home.

**1. Pesky hanging cords**. Yes, it seems small and insignificant, but the cords that hang down behind a mounted TV might put buyers on watch for other issues in the home that make it look messy. Just tuck those cords up and away before giving people a tour of the home.

**2. An unkept yard**. No one likes a mess, especially when they’re planning to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on it. Buyers want to see a clean, crisp yard with nice ground cover and well-cut grass.

**3. A dingy front door**. Replacing your front door and/or garage door can bring you up to a 100% ROI, so if your door is dinged up or sun-faded, do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and replace or repair it.

**4. Obvious signs of pets**. Though you may love your furry friends, it’s a gamble to assume that buyers will also love them. Some people are allergic to pet dander, are highly sensitive to smells, or simply don’t like the messes animals tend to leave. Clean up after your pets before inviting buyers in, and certainly get rid of any odors.

**5. Cobwebs**. Even though I bought my own condo in spite of the fact it was covered in cobwebs, you can’t expect that from most people. The sight of cobwebs is an instant turn-off for a lot of people. Dust those webs away to show buyers how clean your home is.

**6. Poor furniture arrangement**. This is why it’s critical to consult a stager—we can’t sell houses the same way we live in them. When you work with us, we pay for a stager to come in to arrange everything to look nice and inviting.

**7. Junk drawers and crammed cabinets**. Buyers are naturally going to look inside cabinets and drawers, so if yours are jam-packed full of odds and ends, it’ll turn them off. Thin out some of your possessions to make your home showable.

**8. Messy closets**. People look in closets to try to imagine what it would look like if it held their own possessions, but imagining that is hard to do if your closet is crammed full. Take a weekend to declutter your closet space and your buyers will thank you for it.

**9. Cluttered countertops**. Move the sundry items you keep on your counters to a storage space. People want to be able to picture themselves living in your home, but they won’t be able to if it’s not clean and crisp.
