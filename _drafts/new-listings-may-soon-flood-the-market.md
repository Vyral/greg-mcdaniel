A tsunami of unknown listings may be coming to your neighborhood. Here’s what you need to know.

A tsunami of unknown listings may be coming to your neighborhood.

The other day, a little bird was chirping in my ear, saying hundreds of millions (even billions) of dollars have been poured into the tech companies that are so prolific in the Bay Area by VC money. Apparently, the VCs are getting anxious about seeing a return on their investment.

Because of that, we might see a constriction on these companies in the form of layoffs, employees moving, or even the companies folding because they can’t produce the desired results. As a consequence, the VCs may dry up like the Sahara desert and no longer provide the cash they’re going to need, **meaning that a flood of new properties may soon hit the market**.

The moral of this message is to keep your eyes open to what’s going on in the market. If you’re looking to buy a property and don’t want to fight the masses, know that the Fed dropped the interest rate again—but that could increase our rates here in the real estate industry.

However, **I have a list of over 18 properties right now that aren’t yet on the market but are looking to be sold all over Contra Costa County**, including multifamily units, build-ups, rentals, and more.

If you’re looking to buy something as an investor or user, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’ll be glad to get you the information you need.
