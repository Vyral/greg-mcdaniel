<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how the pandemic has affected buyers and sellers.</em></center>

<br>Is it a good time to buy or sell in light of the pandemic?

According to a recent Bloomberg article, over 40% of the workforce now works from home. This isn’t exactly new news; we all know a lot of people are working from home and getting relatively comfortable doing so. However, it does point to a shift in the way real estate is being bought and sold.

There’s a fever pitch among buyers and sellers right now, and **in our area, I believe it’s a phenomenal time to sell**. You have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take advantage of a situation we’ve never seen before. With entire national economies being shut down and so many people relocating, we’re shifting the way we live. Companies are telling employees that they can work from home either full-time or part-time, and they’re moving to where they want to live.

This means many residents of major cities have decided they need more space to move around—condo owners are looking to buy small houses, owners of small houses are looking to buy bigger houses, owners of big houses are looking for more land, etc. Whatever their circumstances, they want more space for their loved ones. In short, if you sell now, you’ll command top dollar.

On the flip side, **it’s a bit of a yin/yang situation for buyers**. Interest rates are low, but prices are high. If you’re thinking about buying but are struggling to find what you want, it might be better to wait until after the election to make your move so the situation clarifies a bit.

No matter what your plans are, I know that life is fluid, so I would love to have a conversation with you and help you achieve all of your real estate goals. Just give me a call or shoot me an email.
