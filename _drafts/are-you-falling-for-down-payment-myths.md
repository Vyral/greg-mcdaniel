<center><em>There are five common myths about down payments that need to be debunked.</em></center>

<br>Today I’ll debunk five common myths about down payments for when it comes time for you to buy a house:

**1\. You need to put 20% down when buying a new property**. This just isn’t true, but surveys show that 41% of prospective buyers believe this. Many programs are designed to help buyers just like you. Around 77% of the programs in our database are specifically meant for down payment and closing cost assistance; 7% help with first mortgages; 6% are specifically earmarked for mortgage credit certificates (MCCs); and the rest are miscellaneous programs to help you get into a home.

**2\. Down payment assistance is only for first-time buyers**. Statistics show that 41% of down payment assistance programs are for people who already have a mortgage or people who haven’t officially owned property in three years. Reach out to your mortgage broker to see what program is right for you.

**3\. Down payment assistance programs aren’t available in my area**. In reality, these programs are widely accessible, with 70% of them available in local areas and 30% available statewide.

**4\. It’s too expensive to buy a home in my market**. Buying a home should never bee too expensive since down payment assistance is available even in high-cost markets. Reports say that 11% of the programs offer incentives including specific programs for community service workers like educators, firefighters, police officers, and healthcare workers. 25% of the programs allow a buyer to purchase a multi-unit property; as long as they live in one of the units, they can collect the rent from the others and offset the cost of the mortgage.

**5\. Down payment programs make home financing harder**. To be precise, there are 2,451 programs nationwide that are waiting for homebuyers to use them; 83% of those programs have funds available right now.

Homeowners can jumpstart their program by completing a homeownership education course, which is typically required to qualify for the program. This education gives homebuyers confidence in the home buying process, financing options, and budgeting. After the homebuyer is approved for the program, the agency will provide documentation that can be submitted with an offer. This is also beneficial to the homeless seller because these programs can sometimes help cover the closing costs.

If you have questions about any of these programs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Hope to hear from you soon\!
