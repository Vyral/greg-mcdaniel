Have you ever wanted to shape a property into your dream home? If so, I have the opportunity for you\!

The property you see behind me was recently beleaguered by a water main break that caused flooding throughout the home. **It’s being gutted as we speak, but it’ll soon be restored and better than ever**.

It’s not currently listed on the market, but this home could still be yours: **If you’re looking to buy a home in the Piedmont area, the owners will sell it right now for $1.4 million**. When all is said and done, the estimated value will be $2 million or thereabouts.

The biggest upside to buying this property is that, since it’s being remodeled, you’ll be able to mold it into your dream home. Let’s take a look inside and begin to envision how you can take a disaster and turn it into a genuine triumph:

**Starting at 0:49 in the video, you can see everything from the balcony view you’ll have outside to the master bedroom to the backyard**.

There you have it. If you have any questions or would like additional information regarding this home, please reach out to my personal line at (925) 915-1978 or you can email me at [Team@McDanielCallahan.com](mailto:Team@McDanielCallahan.com). I look forward to hearing from you\!
