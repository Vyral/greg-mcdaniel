<center>What do you do with your property after a divorce? Here’s my advice.</center>

Here are a few tips to help you navigate the sale of your property if you’re selling it after a divorce:

Like you would to go through the divorce proceedings, you need to **contact a licensed professional to help you navigate these troubled waters**. Since your emotions during the divorce or separation procedure may well be all over the place, the last thing you’ll want to deal with is the antics of a potential homebuyer and their agent. Real estate agents are built-in buffers to save you the hassle of dealing with the complexities of the real estate process.

Next, be sure to **come to a written agreement with the other party in the divorce** about what to do when repairs need to be made on the home. Here, you’ll need to keep your emotions in check—don’t get into petty fights that could otherwise be settled up front in a written agreement.

Especially if you have children, **presenting a united front during a divorce is very important**. Similarly, when you sell a property you own with your ex-spouse after a divorce, you need to think of them as a business partner. Even though you’ve both decided to go different ways in your life, you need to work as a team during the transaction if you want it to go smoothly. If you feel like that will be difficult for you, be sure to reach out to your professional real estate agent and use their advice. Keeping a level head is paramount when undergoing this sort of life change.
