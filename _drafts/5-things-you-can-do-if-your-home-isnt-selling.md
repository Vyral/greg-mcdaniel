<center>There are fix potential fixes for a stagnant home sale.</center>

If you’ve put your home on the market but haven’t had any luck selling it, **here are five tips that will help you reach your goal:**

**1\. Change your agent**. It’s an unfortunate fact of life that sometimes people hire a Realtor because they’re a friend, family member, past client in some other business, etc. It’s unfortunate because not all agents are created equal—some just can’t sell a home properly for a variety of reasons.

**2\. Change the price**. If your home isn’t selling, there’s a good chance it’s overpriced. This might not be your agent’s fault. They’re pricing your home based on comparable properties, and the market can shift in an instant. Reexamining your home’s comparable properties and adjusting the price may be just the trick to getting your home sold. Pricing your home is a business decision. If you want to sell but don’t need to, feel free to take it off the market and wait a little bit. If you need to sell, though, make the price adjustment.

**3\. Add video to your marketing strategy**. A lot of sellers are unaware of all the work that goes into marketing a home, but video is something that absolutely must be a part of it. For example, Zillow allows you to add a two-minute silent video to your home’s listing profile on their website. This adds context to its photos so that buyers can really get a better feel for the interior. If your agent isn’t using video to sell your home, you need to rethink who you’re doing business with.

**4\. Make sure your home is clean**. Not only that, but it should smell good, too. People’s senses influence what they remember about a home. If they walk into one that’s super cold, super hot, messy, or foul-smelling, they’ll be automatically turned off. If your home qualifies as all of the above, you’re dead in the water. Your home should be the type of home you’d want to walk into if you were a buyer.

**5\. Take the home off the market and try again later**. If you’ve tried the four previous tips and your home still isn’t selling, it might just not be your time to sell, so consider taking it off the market and waiting for the market to shift. You can also consider renting it out in the meantime. A lot of agents would scorn me for advising a seller to take their home off the market. But I’m not them. My interest is in what’s best for you.
