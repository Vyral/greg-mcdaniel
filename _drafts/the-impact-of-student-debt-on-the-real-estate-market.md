What’s the effect of student loan debt? Let’s find out.

Student debt isn’t an issue that affects only students who took out loans: **It affects everyone in real estate**.

Most of you and your families either had or currently have student debt (or will in the future). If your children get into student debt, it will dramatically lower their ability to purchase a home and create wealth down the line.

I recently came across [an article](https://www.zillow.com/research/student-debt-homes-renters-22051/){: target="_blank"} that goes into detail about how much student debt affects the market on a national basis. **I’d like to share some of the numbers I found:**

* Based on today’s home values, renters who carry student debt can only afford to buy homes up to $269,400. Renters without student debt can go up to $361,800.
* 33.9% of renters looking to buy in the next year have some form of student debt.
* Renters with student debt can only afford 52.3% of homes on the market.

Student debt has reached its all-time highest levels, **sitting at $1.56 trillion in the 3rd quarter of 2018**. The average monthly payment for someone with student debt is $388; in some parts of the country, **people are paying more for their student debt than for their rent**.

If you’d like to take an in-depth look at your student debt to figure out how to buy a home, reach out to me. We can figure out what will work best in your situation. In the meantime, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
