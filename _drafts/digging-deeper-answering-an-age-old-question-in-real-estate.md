When is the best time to sell your home? To answer this question, we sought the advice of some friends of ours, and what they found may surprise you.

It’s an age-old question in real estate and it’s one that’s on more than a few minds: **When is the best time to sell my home?**

Our good friends over at [HomeLight](https://www.homelight.com/){: target="_blank"}—a real estate platform—felt that they needed to unearth the answer to this question. They crunched the numbers and arrived at some interesting findings: **They discovered that on average spring is the best time to sell, but notably, there are some exceptions**.

Take the town of Greenville, South Carolina: Homelight found that, during July, their market beat the average list price by a whopping 150%. In Breckenridge, Colorado, they topped the average listing price of a home by 106% in the month of February. Further south in Tomball, Texas, their market saw homes selling for 133% over the average list price in October.

Simply put, **this data goes to show that there’s no objectively perfect time to sell your home**. There are so many factors at play: The type of area you’re in, demographics, geographics, political climate, and even weather.

So if you’re thinking about selling anytime soon, please give us a call at 925-838-4300, and we can work through the complexities together to help you secure the best deal possible. I look forward to hearing from you!
