When it comes to real estate, there’s a weird stigma surrounding the fall season. A lot of people seem to believe that it’s a bad time to buy or sell, but it’s completely untrue. I’ve bought a majority of my own properties in the fall and winter months. **Here’s why fall is so great for real estate:**

**1\. There’s less competition:** Fewer buyers and sellers are looking to make a sale, so you’re not having to compete with the crowds. Buyers will be more likely to get their offers accepted and sellers will get more eyes looking at their home.

**2\. Holidays:** You can make the holidays work well for you as a seller. It’s a good time to fill your home with the wonderful smells of the season and create an inviting atmosphere. Cook a pumpkin pie, serve some eggnog, and get some holiday cheer going. It makes your house feel more like a home.

**3\. You can get great deals:** If you’re looking for a home to renovate, fall is full of deals for appliances, cookware, electronics, and home remodeling services. Toward the end of the year, retailers are pushing out old models to make room for new ones.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, fall is always a great time to jump into the market. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
