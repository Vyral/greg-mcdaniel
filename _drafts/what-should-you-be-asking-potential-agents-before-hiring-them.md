Here at the McDaniel Callahan Team, we have a combined 97 years of experience in the real estate industry and we’ve come across tons of different scenarios and situations. **There are three different questions that we’ve found to be the most important when you’re looking to hire a real estate agent:**

**1\. How many deals have you done in the last 12 months?** The reason you want to ask this is very simple. You want to be sure that any agent you hire will be able to handle your sale with the highest level of professionalism in today’s market. The higher the number, the better.

**2\. Can I have the contact information of your last three clients?** This is basically the agent’s own personal Yelp\! You want to see the reviews from their past clients from their past clients’ mouths. It’s that simple.

**3\. What is your marketing strategy for my specific needs?** Everybody’s needs are different. Some need more money, some need a quick sale, and some need A+ online marketing. That’s why it’s important to ask your agent what their plan is for your specific needs.
