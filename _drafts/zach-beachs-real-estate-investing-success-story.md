I recently had a conversation with Zach Beach about the process of breaking into real estate investing.

If you’ve ever considered investing in real estate, but you decided against it because of all the barriers before you—time, money, or otherwise—today’s message is for you. Joining me today is investing professional, Zach Beach, to deconstruct those barriers for you.

With more than 27 years of experience working in real estate, Zach and his family focus their efforts on a niche part of the market: **They buy and sell properties without the use of their own cash, credit, or reliance on lenders**.

They buy and sell properties on contracts in a way that allows them to leverage other people’s money and positions in order to create enormous paydays that typically last between 36 and 60 months.

Interestingly enough, Zach’s background is as a personal trainer and bartender, which is certainly a far cry from real estate. Since transitioning over, though, he’s found such success working in real estate that he has closed 100 deals via this method in just three years’ time!<br>&nbsp;

**Zach asserts that the fact that he could join the ranks with little to no background in real estate is just a testament to the tried-and-true system his family has built**.

I’ve even experienced the power of this system firsthand: On my show, Beers and Calls, I decided to give Zach’s script a shot with callers who didn’t know me from Adam and, remarkably, many who called in took interest in learning more about his system.

To learn more about the ins and outs of Zach and his family’s system and the scripts they use, you can visit [SRECRadioBook.com](http://hugewhy-045226.pages.infusionsoft.net/?cookieUUID=fa3a943a-9c28-42c7-a370-a12dcb6eb84a){: target="_blank"} and pick up a copy of “Real Estate On Your Terms: Create Continuous Cash Flow Now, Without Using Your Cash Or Credit”, written by Zach’s father-in-law, Chris Prefontaine. And you can reach out to Zach to learn more directly from him as well.

As always, if you have any questions for me related to real estate, please call me at (925) 838-4300 or you can email me at [TEAM@McDanielCallahan.com](mailto:TEAM@McDanielCallahan.com). I’ll see you in the next video!
