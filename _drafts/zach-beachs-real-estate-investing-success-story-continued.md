Continuing our conversation with Zach Beach, this time he shares with us how he used his family's investment strategy to purchase his own home.

Welcome to the second half of my two-part interview with real estate investing extraordinaire Zach Beach. If you missed part one of our interview, you can [check it out here](https://mcdanielcallahanblog.com/zach-beachs-real-estate-investing-success-story.html){: target="_blank"}.

With more than 27 years of experience working in real estate, Zach and his family focus their efforts on a niche part of the market: They buy and sell properties without the use of their own cash, credit, or reliance on lenders.

As I mentioned in part 1, Zach believes in the system he and his family have built so much that he purchased his own home using this very system. How did he do it? Zach found a home that was For Sale by Owner (FSBO), he presented a program to the seller, and structured a deal that afforded him 36 months to finance the home.

In the meantime, he put down $2,500 on his future $500,000 property. As time wore on, he chipped away at the principal payments each month as he took over the mortgage. By the time he was ready to buy the home, he was able to put down $36,000, with no lender financing necessary!

To learn more about the ins and outs of Zach and his family’s system and the scripts they use, you can visit SRECRadioBook.com and pick up a copy of “Real Estate On Your Terms: Create Continuous Cash Flow Now, Without Using Your Cash Or Credit”, written by Zach’s father-in-law, Chris Prefontaine. And you can reach out to Zach to learn more directly from him as well.
