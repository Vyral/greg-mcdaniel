<br>Today we’re taking a look at myth No. 6 in our 15-part series of home selling myths that need to be abolished and burned at the stake. The myth in question this time? Real estate agents don’t purposely overprice properties.

**Sorry to burst your bubble, but they do**. It’s called “buying the listing.” It’s a dirty little secret, but it’s one that you might have heard about. Many of us know that there are agents out there who will pretty much say anything they can when it comes to pricing in order to get a listing, then once it goes on the market they’ll readjust the price.

I’m not saying that all agents do this consistently. **However, I do know that agents on our team have never bought listings**. Ever. We’ve lost listings because of that, but we feel that telling the truth is much more important than a quick buck.

I wanted you to keep this in mind because our next myth is, “The real estate agent with the lowest commission will net the seller more.” Is this true? Stay tuned to find out.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
