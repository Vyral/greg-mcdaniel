Are you ready for some fun in the Bay Area this Halloween? Here are the events that you need to attend this month.

Welcome to Fun in the Bay: Halloween Edition. We have some really fun events coming up in the area that we want to give you the lowdown on today.

**First, we have the Speakeasy SF Halloween Party Cruise**. It’s on October 27th from 8:00 p.m. until 1 a.m. and it will be taking place on a 3-story, 30,000 sq ft. yacht, the largest such boat on the West Coast. It’s a flapper-themed party that you can [get tickets for and learn much more about here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/speakeasy-sf-halloween-party-cruise-tickets-49208382597?aff=ebdssbdestsearch).

**Next, we have the Oakland Zoo’s Boo at the Zoo, which is going to be a great event for the whole family**. It’s taking place on October 27 and 28 from 10:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Once you pay to get admission into the zoo, you’ll be able to stroll the zoo in costume while collecting yummy treats. You’ll be able to go for a ride on the spooky boo train, join in on a cool dance party, get your face painted, and make some treats for the animals. All kids who show up in costume will receive a free ride ticket. [Learn more about this fun event here](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/programs-and-events/boo-at-the-zoo).

[Here’s a link to grab tickets](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-thriller-tickets-50682360304?aff=ebdssbdestsearch).

If that’s not your scene, consider attending the Halloween Dance Party at Eve’s Waterfront, a great restaurant in the Bay Area. It’s located on the water in Oakland and taking place from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM. There will be multiple different DJs spinning records, a fun dance party, ghostly eats, and a welcome cocktail. [You can get tickets to the event here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-party-eves-waterfront-tickets-50499827343?aff=ebdssbdestsearch) (early bird tickets are only $20).
