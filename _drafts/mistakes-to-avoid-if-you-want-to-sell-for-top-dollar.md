<center><em>These are the seven mistakes you&rsquo;ll have to avoid if you want top dollar.</em></center>

<br>Let’s be honest: When you’re selling your home, there are probably more than seven mistakes that you’ll try to avoid, but today we’re going to share the top seven that are critical to sidestep if you want to sell your home for the most money possible.

**1\. Picking the wrong agent**. Pick someone with experience who knows the market and has comprehensive marketing knowledge to highlight your property in the right light. You also want someone who is a great communicator, not only with you but also with other agents.

&nbsp;**2\. Overpricing the property**. Consumers are savvier these days than ever. They can find all of their information online to get a much better idea of what your home is truly worth. If it’s overpriced, they will know, and many may not even come and look at the home. That will lead to a stale listing and price adjustment.

**3\. Only considering the highest offer**. Many terms make up an offer. Price is important, but it’s not the only thing you should consider. Don’t just automatically go for the highest price, look for the offer that presents the most value to you.

**4\. Failing to prepare your home**. If there are simple fixes we can make, like painting or power washing, we want to do that before you start showing the home and put it on the market. You don’t have to remodel anything, but you do need to make your home shine.

**5\. Not allowing showings**. When a buyer calls, you have to let them see the property if you want it to sell. Even though it might be inconvenient, the easier it is to show the home, the better your opportunity to sell it.

**6\. Getting too emotional**. A real estate transaction is a business transaction, but it’s one of the largest transactions you’ll ever make. You have to be level-headed and detached emotionally to get the best deal.

**7\. Failing to declutter the home**. Depersonalize the house so that a buyer can envision their family in the home. You’re going to be moving anyway, so why not get a headstart on moving by packing away those personal items? What’s more, there is a possibility that someone who is touring your home could get away with some of your valuables in their pockets.
