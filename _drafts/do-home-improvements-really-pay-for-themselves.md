<center><em>Most home improvements don&rsquo;t pay for themselves, but two do!</em></center>

<br>Today is all about myth No. 13 out of 15 in our Selling Myths series. Have you fallen for it?

Myth: Home improvements pay for themselves. This is a myth I often have to dispel. Unfortunately, **you only recoup about 64% of your investment, on average, from improvements when you renovate your home**.

However, there are two updates that usually get you a 110% to 150% return on the investment: a garage door and veneer stone siding. So if you’re considering making enhancements, begin with your garage door; it makes a massive difference when buyers drive up to your house.

Remember, when you own a home, it’s not always about remodeling to sell; it’s about living a lifestyle that makes you comfortable. **Do what makes you happy to spend time in your home**.

If you have questions about this myth or anything else real estate related, reach out via phone or email. I’d love to help you.
